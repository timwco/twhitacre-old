title: Joining the Iron Yard
---

I’ve had the privilege over the years to work with some amazing companies and startups and am excited to bring my experiences into the classroom. For me, being able to spend my days building and talking about development is a dream come true.

I first got into programming about 12 years ago and had to learn everything on my own. There was no Iron Yard, no online training and just a few books I could find at the library. Even then I still found that the best way to learn was to immerse myself and to actually build something. It wasn’t too long after that I developed my first app, began attending JavaScript conferences and started to feel like a part of the community.

Coming to The Iron Yard is exciting for two reasons. First (and most importantly) it is because they are an awesome company filled with great people and amazing students. I’ve only been around campus for a week but spending time with some of the current students has been one of the best parts. Listening to stories of what they are learning, what they are struggling with and what they are planning to build has been very humbling.

Secondly, it’s the south. I was born in Florida and lived the first 18 years of my life in a warmer climate and am excited to be back. Living in the north was definitely an experience and one that I won’t soon forget but from the day my wife and I got married we’ve constantly talked about moving south. In the past week, I not only sold my snow blower but also tried boiled peanuts for the first time.
