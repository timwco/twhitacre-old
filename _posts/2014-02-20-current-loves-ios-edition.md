Well, it’s finally starting to warm up here in Northeast PA and I’m neck deep in finishing a soon to be released update to [Unmark](https://twitter.com/unmarkit) (formerly nilai.co).

I get asked quite often by friends what are the most used apps on my iPhone. I thought this would be a great place to share them.

The image below is a screenshot of my actual home screen on my iPhone 5. I’ve had it this way for probably the last 6 months and don’t plan to change anytime soon. Although with the thousands of app developers out there… that could change tomorrow.

Here is a breakdown of some of my favorite apps.

I also do keep up on some social sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Foursquare and thus they landed a spot on my home screen. 

There are also many others I didn’t mention. If you have any questions or wonder what any are, feel free to hit me up on the [tweetbox](http://twitter.com/timwco).
