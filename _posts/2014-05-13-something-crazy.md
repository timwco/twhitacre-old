> I'm going to challenge you to do something crazy...

That was the first line in an email I received less than 1 month after the startup I was at ran into some trouble. And crazy it is, but also very exciting.

__TL;DR__ _Steph and I are moving to Atlanta._

We are excited to become a part of such an amazing [team](http://theironyard.com/about/team/) but also for all of the opportunity that Atlanta brings for both of us. I might write more about this in the months to come, but for now just read [Steph's post](http://stephwhitacre.com/chasing-dream/).

Lastly, I just want to publicly thank all of our friends and family who have been so incredibly helpful this last week. We could not do this without you.
