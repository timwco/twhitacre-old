        <title>Blogging Platforms</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As an instructor at &lt;a href=&quot;http://theironyard.com&quot;&gt;The Iron Yard&lt;/a&gt;, I get asked this question a lot. Here is a VERY simple breakdown of some of my thoughts on different platforms. This is by no means comprehensive, but I feel it gives a pretty solid overview of the platforms I&amp;#39;ve had experience with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.com&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Upsides&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to set up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up and running really quick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple themes to choose from&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom Domain Support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Downsides&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not very editable without paying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fairly generic looking (not really a bad thing though)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tumblr.com&quot;&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Upsides&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to set up and use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple themes to choose from&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom domain support
*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Downsides&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes not taken seriously&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://medium.com/&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Upsides&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exposure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extremely social&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Downsides&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No custom domain support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not customizable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only one &amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org&quot;&gt;WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Upsides&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fully customizable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Downsides&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be time consuming your first time to set up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Costs (you need hosting and a domain)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have to manage it and keep it up to date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://getbarley.com&quot;&gt;Barley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Upsides - &lt;em&gt;spoiler alert, I had a hand in building this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extremely Customizable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hosted for you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dropbox Sync&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple to use template tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Downsides&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You still need to touch HTML if you want it customized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has a higher monthly cost than some others listed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Upsides&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extremely customizable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hostable on Github&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Static site, so it&amp;#39;s really fast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Downsides&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not super easy to work with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different than normal workflow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Learning</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We are past the halfway mark for the first Front End class in Atlanta. We are moving fast and everyone is keeping up in an incredible way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have walked through a handful of tools, libraries and frameworks. We have also spent a good amount of time talking through programming theory and best practice. One of the pieces that makes The Iron Yard stand out is that we put a large focus on learning how to learn. Let’s face it, in 12 weeks we can’t even begin to cover every library and framework and every aspect of HTML5. Let’s not forget about what’s coming in ECMAScript 6. Sure we’ve talked about it, but more importantly, we’ve talked about the fact that it’s coming and how it won’t stop there. New frameworks are coming out every week and the best way to keep up is to learn what to look for. It helps to have a broad enough understanding of the language to break it down and judge for yourself if it will be useful to you or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, we still dive pretty deep into JavaScript core. We spent a while writing vanilla JavaScript before we introduced jQuery, Underscore and a handful of other libraries. We also talked through the myriad of MV* frameworks and currently we are walking through Backbone.js. We start here because it is a library with a low barrier to entry. It helps round out the idea of JavaScript constructors and gives us a great way to organize our code for building applications. We are about a week into Backbone and each student in the class is building their own version of a blog. This might sound like a simple project to a few of you, but keep in mind that 6 weeks ago many of our students had never opened a text editor before. That, to me, is incredible!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the only way this can be accomplished is because of the immersive environment that The Iron Yard provides. After all, perseverance does pay off and working hard for something you want is a great feeling. Even as the instructor of the class, I’m learning more about programming and myself with each lecture. I am falling more in love with this craft each day and glad to have a group of people along for the ride with me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Perseverance</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It is hard to believe Atlanta’s first Front End Engineering class is now finishing their fourth week. I think back to the dinner we had together the night before class began. Here was a group coming from all over, meeting for the first time and embarking on a twelve week journey. We all came from different backgrounds, states, and skill levels; yet we all shared a common commitment to grow and learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any legendary journey, the most rewarding roads are also the most difficult. By the third week of class, I began to notice tired eyes and messed up hair - probably the result of sleeping on campus the night before. Many became weary in their exploration, their discouragement obvious from their sighs as they stared at their monitor or the open conversation they had with me about their struggles. As much as I wanted to tell them to take a week off, I knew that reaching our destination in twelve weeks would mean pushing forward to the end goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we pushed forward and were rewarded with week four. Frustration melted to excitement. The concepts we had been covering were just now starting to click. Not just in programming, but in all areas of life, it is a proud moment when you invest in mastering something for a long time and it finally begins to work correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the students were really starting to understand what they were doing, and knowing I wanted to keep pushing them, we spent part of the fourth week doing their first group project. Students divided into three groups and I gave them a wireframe and a fairly vague project summary and sent them off running. Not only would they have to utilize all of the skills they have learned so far but find a way to use these in a team setting. Up until now all of their work has been solo. It has been incredible to see how they are all coming together, dividing up tasks and even implementing some agile development methods to get their work done. They are learning to communicate with each other and what it means to work as part of a team. They have been able to use their creativity to think outside the box and explore some things that I don’t think we would have specifically covered in a lecture. Once they finish the project they will be presenting them to the class and sharing what worked and what didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week has been a welcome retreat from the struggles of the first three weeks. Don’t get me wrong, we still have a LOT to cover in the next eight weeks and I expect more frustration, hair pulling, and perplexing stares at their screen. The reality is that in the journey of programming, there are always moments of frustration and hitting one’s head against the wall. New tools and processes come out every day and we have to keep up. But I hope my students will join me in saying that the hard perseverance of week three met with the glory of week four is what makes being a developer so enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Joining the Iron Yard</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve had the privilege over the years to work with some amazing companies and startups and am excited to bring my experiences into the classroom. For me, being able to spend my days building and talking about development is a dream come true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first got into programming about 12 years ago and had to learn everything on my own. There was no Iron Yard, no online training and just a few books I could find at the library. Even then I still found that the best way to learn was to immerse myself and to actually build something. It wasn’t too long after that I developed my first app, began attending JavaScript conferences and started to feel like a part of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming to The Iron Yard is exciting for two reasons. First (and most importantly) it is because they are an awesome company filled with great people and amazing students. I’ve only been around campus for a week but spending time with some of the current students has been one of the best parts. Listening to stories of what they are learning, what they are struggling with and what they are planning to build has been very humbling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it’s the south. I was born in Florida and lived the first 18 years of my life in a warmer climate and am excited to be back. Living in the north was definitely an experience and one that I won’t soon forget but from the day my wife and I got married we’ve constantly talked about moving south. In the past week, I not only sold my snow blower but also tried boiled peanuts for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Something Crazy</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to challenge you to do something crazy...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the first line in an email I received less than 1 month after the startup I was at ran into some trouble. And crazy it is, but also very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Steph and I are moving to Atlanta.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are excited to become a part of such an amazing &lt;a href=&quot;http://theironyard.com/about/team/&quot;&gt;team&lt;/a&gt; but also for all of the opportunity that Atlanta brings for both of us. I might write more about this in the months to come, but for now just read &lt;a href=&quot;http://stephwhitacre.com/chasing-dream/&quot;&gt;Steph&amp;#39;s post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I just want to publicly thank all of our friends and family who have been so incredibly helpful this last week. We could not do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Year for Whisk(e)y</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve followed me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/timwco&quot;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://instagram.com/timwco&quot;&gt;instagram&lt;/a&gt; you know that I like to indulge once in a while. So far my drink of choice has been gin. &lt;a href=&quot;http://instagram.com/p/jkzy3AJG50/&quot;&gt;Plymouth Gin&lt;/a&gt; to be exact. As great as gin is, I have been told I should be drinking whiskey, at least some of the time. This includes all forms, bourbon, scotch, irish, rye and the likes. I’ll be honest, so far my favorite is rye with scotch being a close second but I have a long list to try and will hopefully be adding to the list as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even my wife is pushing me towards it by getting me the book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Drink-More-Whiskey-Everything-Favorite/dp/1452109745&quot;&gt;Drink More Whiskey&lt;/a&gt; as well as some nice &lt;a href=&quot;http://buck4men.bigcartel.com/product/buck-signature-low-ball-glass&quot;&gt;low ball glasses&lt;/a&gt;, whiskey stones and everything else one might need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So without further ado, check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://timw.co/whiskey&quot;&gt;my whiskey list&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear your feedback. Is there something obvious I’ve missed or a small craft distillery I’ve not heard of? If you have any suggestions, hit me up on twitter as I’d love to see what else is out there.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>So Many Bookmarks</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t have to tell you this, but there is a lot of stuff on the internet. Obviously most of it is junk, but there is a lot of great content. This begs the question, “how do I consume it all” or rather, “how do I consume as much as I can that is relevant to me so I can keep up to speed in my industry”. This is not an easy task and because content and the way content is presented continually changes, you almost have no choice but to use some sort of service to help you keep up with it all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it is an aggregation service like &lt;a href=&quot;http://thenews.im/&quot;&gt;thenews.im&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://flyosity.com/interesting/&quot;&gt;interesting app&lt;/a&gt;, whatever your poison it still doesn’t help with things your friends, co-workers and twitter users share. You need a way to trap that content so when you have a chance to take a break you haven’t forgotten it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In walks &lt;a href=&quot;https://unmark.it&quot;&gt;Unmark&lt;/a&gt;. Many may have guessed I would talk about this eventually as I had a hand in building it, but I was part of this build because I knew the way I was saving my bookmarks was broken. Every service I used, while many were good, they still missed something. I’ve found that they just fill up with links I never visit again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take this situation for example: I’m sitting at my desk working and a co-worker says I should read this article. I don’t want to stop what I’m doing but is throwing it into one of these services the best idea. I’m not even sure what the article is about and not sure if I really am interested in it. This is the same for videos, code examples and any other link that is shared or I stumble upon throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, IMO is why Unmark is so awesome. Our tagline for it is ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://unmark.it&quot;&gt;The to do app for your bookmarks&lt;/a&gt;”. This means as a piece of content comes along during the day, I can simply throw it into my Unmark account. Later that night from my iPad or phone I can go through the list of marks I saved and see if they really are as good as I first thought. If they are, I can send them to be read later, or watch the video right inside of Unmark. If it is a recipe, I can look at the ingredient list and determine if I want to put in in a recipe storage app. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Unmark can be used in many different ways, this is how I use it and I have found it has changed the way I view content and the content I do end up consuming is more relevant and meaningful to me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Scranton… Meet CoalWork</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Coworking is not a new concept at all. In fact not too long ago while working from home I was doing a ton of research for a coworking spot in this area. Unfortunately there wasn’t one… or at least one that I could be a part of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, anyone reading this who isn’t local might not realize that Scranton (and the surrounding area) is not a very technical place. I would even say that there are not really many tech companies in the area either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/PBs0tS46TlyZlmOGw7vl&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, some of the guys I work with are trying to change that. Enter &lt;a href=&quot;http://coalwork.com&quot;&gt;CoalWork&lt;/a&gt;, a forthcoming coworking spot. We are still in the early stages but hope this will become a staple in city. We hope through this we’ll meet some awesome people, learn some new things and possibly even change the way this area views tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who is interested, feel free to check out the website or follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/coalwork&quot;&gt;CoalWork on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Current Loves : iOS Edition</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s finally starting to warm up here in Northeast PA and I’m neck deep in finishing a soon to be released update to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/unmarkit&quot;&gt;Unmark&lt;/a&gt; (formerly nilai.co).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get asked quite often by friends what are the most used apps on my iPhone. I thought this would be a great place to share them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image below is a screenshot of my actual home screen on my iPhone 5. I’ve had it this way for probably the last 6 months and don’t plan to change anytime soon. Although with the thousands of app developers out there… that could change tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a breakdown of some of my favorite apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/6EeMF8uORle55vGcbtrr&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photo App - &lt;a href=&quot;http://campl.us/&quot;&gt;Camera Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browser - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/mobile/ios.html&quot;&gt;Chrome for iOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weather - &lt;a href=&quot;http://checktheweather.co/&quot;&gt;Check the Weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lists - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.anylistapp.com/&quot;&gt;AnyList&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reader - &lt;a href=&quot;https://getpocket.com/ios/&quot;&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pod Catcher - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shiftyjelly.com/pocketcasts&quot;&gt;Pocket Casts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Music - &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rdio/id335060889&quot;&gt;Rdio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;News - &lt;a href=&quot;http://flyosity.com/interesting/&quot;&gt;Interesting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mail - Default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calendar - Default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also do keep up on some social sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Foursquare and thus they landed a spot on my home screen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also many others I didn’t mention. If you have any questions or wonder what any are, feel free to hit me up on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/timwco&quot;&gt;tweetbox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thoughts on Email</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;First, let me clarify my relationship with email. When it comes the jobs I’ve had, I went from working in an office, to working from home, doing freelance and now back in an office. It might not sound like much of a switch, but each one required different levels of communication to stay up to speed. For instance, my first office job was in a building that had about 150 employees. Not huge, but a lot of people were not close by. When it came to the developers and designers I was currently sharing a project with, we used instant message, but when it came to people in a different division (or people I’d rather not talk to that often) email came in mighty handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I left my first office job, and started working from home I realized that I would need to step up my email game. Again, anyone I was working with very closely, we kept in contact through IM or a chatroom like Campfire. The difference this time was not the size of the company (only about 10 people) but rather the fact that sometimes something was just too long to say in a quick message. At my office job, I would walk over to that person, pull up a chair and have a conversation. From home, this wasn’t possible. My options were either Skype or email. Since Skype takes a minimum of 10 minutes and 5 crashes before successfully starting, I usually chose email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today. I’m back working full time in an office. This time however, the team is small at only 7 people, with 5 of them being in earshot of me all day long. More important than this though, we’ve started using a program called &lt;a href=&quot;http://slack.com&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; (which I highly recommend) and it has all but rid my need of email for the work I’m currently doing. We also use other tools like &lt;a href=&quot;http://trello.com&quot;&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt; and Google Docs. All of this combined there isn’t much reason for me to open email at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on my current situation, I am going to try something. This has been suggested many times before by other people in a variety of ways, but starting today, I’m only going to check my email 3 times a day. I’m going to attempt to check it morning, noon and afternoon/evening. This way, I can still get back to people in a timely fashion but the constant barrage or email flooding in throughout the day won’t distract me from what I’m currently trying to accomplish. The only time I will break this is if someone needs something and I have to send it via email or if someone specifically tells me to check my email for an attachment. Otherwise, they will have to wait to get a response from me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, my biggest issue is not email from friends, family or co-workers, but rather the fringe email that makes its way in. I’ve signed up for quite a few newsletters over the years. Many I’m still happy to be a part of and a few that I wish would just let me unsubscribe. The problem isn’t that I don’t want to read them, but rather that I do. I want to see the updates on the new app coming out, and I want to read what some of my friends wrote about, but I don’t NEED to read about it right now. I’ve begun treating email like a glorified checklist of items I need to work through, with the goal of having all accomplished (archived or deleted). This means if one comes in while I’m working on something, the tendency is to jump over and take care of it. By removing the constant thread of email coming in throughout the day and limiting it to a few times a day, I can easily stay focused and possibly even reduce some stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can always hit me up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/timwco&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, as I’ll usually respond much quicker there.&lt;/p&gt;
