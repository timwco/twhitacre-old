    <span class="date">September 3, 2011</span>
    <div class="post-content">
      Just got back from vacation and it was wonderful. I absolutely love what I do, but even those of us who have our "dream jobs" need a vacation from it every once in a while.

My wife and I were able to spend the last week at a cabin on Lake Anna in the middle of Virginia. We planned our trip perfectly so there was very few people on the lake while we were there. We spent our days kayaking around the lake and swimming just off shore near our cabin.
On the last night there we laid out on the dock and just talked about the things in our lives we loved, the things we hated and the things we wanted to improve upon. I feel as though this was a huge highlight of the trip.

      So getting ready to leave for Purple Door Festival 2011 tomorrow and in the meantime I thought I'd throw together a quick mobile app using jQuery Mobile so I'd have a better way of keeping the schedule in my pocket.
Anyone interested can find it here - Purple Door Mobile Schedule

    <div class="post-content">
      I consider myself luck that over the past 3 years I've been able to be a part of Parker Hill and their student ministries department. Over this last weekend I was able to take part in what is called the 30 hour fast. Basically all of the students from middle school to high school raise money and awareness by giving up their right to eat for 30 hours.
Here's a clip of the highlight video:
