    <span class="date">October 15, 2011</span>
    <div class="post-content">
      Well, I updated to iOS 5.0 just a couple days ago and so far so good. It's hard to believe that an OS update of any kind can show considerable improvement in speed when the device hasn't changed at all... as I'm still running the iPhone 4.
I'm very impressed with the updates to the notifications and the camera as a whole but to me the one thing that I love the most is the text-expansion. I'll admit it, I'm not very good at texting and having the ability to create my own shortcuts makes for a much easier time to respond to the few texts I get on a daily basis.
My favorite so far is "amw"... when I type that it will expand to "let me ask my wife". This gets me out of a lot of things I don't want to do.

    <span class="date">September 3, 2011</span>
    <div class="post-content">
      Just got back from vacation and it was wonderful. I absolutely love what I do, but even those of us who have our "dream jobs" need a vacation from it every once in a while.

My wife and I were able to spend the last week at a cabin on Lake Anna in the middle of Virginia. We planned our trip perfectly so there was very few people on the lake while we were there. We spent our days kayaking around the lake and swimming just off shore near our cabin.
On the last night there we laid out on the dock and just talked about the things in our lives we loved, the things we hated and the things we wanted to improve upon. I feel as though this was a huge highlight of the trip.

      So getting ready to leave for Purple Door Festival 2011 tomorrow and in the meantime I thought I'd throw together a quick mobile app using jQuery Mobile so I'd have a better way of keeping the schedule in my pocket.
Anyone interested can find it here - Purple Door Mobile Schedule
