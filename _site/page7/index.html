    <div class="post-content">
      It's no secret that I thoroughly enjoy music, but many may not know that I also play myself. I have the privilege of co-leading the student band at our church on a weekly basis and getting to lead a group of up to 75 middle school students in worship every Sunday.
Another thing about me is I'm a gear hound... I can never seem to have enough. While I consider myself very good with our finances, I do have a week spot.
Over the last few weeks, I've been re-building my pedal board and somehow in the middle of it all, I also picked up a new guitar.
We'll start with the guitar. It's a Ibanez Artcore AS73, a semi-hollow body guitar that sounds just as pretty as it looks. Since I play a variety of different types of music, I needed something that was a little less aggressive than my current guitar (Schecter C1-Elite) and I just happened to find this guitar for a steal.
After my bank account recovered from that purchase, I went back to finalizing my pedal board... for now.
I'll break it down for you based off of the signal chain (from my guitar to my amp).


Korg Pitch Black Tuner - best tuner I've ever used... especially on a dark stage
SHO Clone - this is similar to an EP Booster... it gives my signal a boost while preserving the sound
CMATMODS Brownie - this is one of the best overdrive pedals I've ever played. I keep the drive down low and use it for less aggressive songs.
Fulltone OCD - this is my second overdrive pedal and I use it for more aggressive songs. It can go from a sweet overdrive to a crushing distortion all while sounding unbelievable. I will never have a pedal board without this one.
Ernie Ball Passive Volume Pedal - controls volume
Boss DD5 (with external tap tempo I built myself) - I keep this on the dotted eighth note setting and tap in the tempo of the song we are playing.
Boss RV5 - I'm not HUGE on reverb, but I do like this pedal a lot. I generally keep it on the modulation setting but changed it up every now and then.
Lastly, I run from my RV5 to a Line 6 POD 2.0 and essentially use that as my amp. I use the Vox AC 15 setting and I've very happy with the overall sound.

      Life tends to stay pretty hectic.... and I rarely have time to pick up new projects. However, when a good friend approached me with a new idea a month or so back, I knew I would be a fool not to go for it.
I won't go into too much detail as of yet... but basically I'll say this:
EVERYONE eats produce... from one place or another and with all the new technology out there, the produce game is changing. We recognize that and also see an opportunity to create a product that will help make the lives of both consumers and growers better. You could say we are bridging a gap between the grower and the consumer.
We'll be releasing more details later but in the meantime though, enjoy this picture of some homemade sauce we made while discussing the product and be sure to check out our website - http://producebrands.com

    <div class="post-content">
      
This summer I had the awesome opportunity to go on a trip with a group of students from our church. The trip is called iPac and last for two weeks. The first part of the trip was a serving part, where the students helped build a home for Habitat for Humanity of Greater Birmingham. The second week was spent at a camp in Panama City Beach, Florida called BigStuf.
I had the privilege to join the students for the second week (yes I know... the easy part), but it was still well worth it.
This is yet just another reason as to why I love how my church does student ministry, and am so grateful to be a part of it.
