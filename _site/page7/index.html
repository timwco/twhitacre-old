    <div class="post-content">So yesterday I was thinking it was time to clean up my computer a little bit as I felt it was running a little sluggish. I looked around and finally found a program called "Mac Keeper" and thought I'd give it a try. I should have done my research first as it ended up deleting quite a few of things I needed, such as a ton of program settings. Now I'm sure there's a setting that would avoid this but either way it happened.
Also, some how it managed to delete a working folder of a project which was 90% complete. Once I realized this I went into complete shock and began a search for a program that could recover the data. I finally found a program that would get my settings back but that folder was gone for good. I put my head down and realized I'd have to start all over from scratch and knew I had better quit sulking and just get to it.
Funny thing though, I was able to re-create the ENTIRE project in less than 30 minutes compared to the hours it took to get there prior. Why was this? I guess the human mind just works in amazing ways. I felt like Shawn Spencer on Psych... as I created new files with the same name, the code just came back to me... and flowed out of my fingertips to the screen.
My lucky day I guess...

    <div class="post-content">
So it's been a bit since I've added anything to my pedal board (which I will review at some point), but I was recently given a gift from a client. It's an Ernie Ball Volume Pedal JR. I've never used a VP before but have always been interested in getting one. The pedal came in the mail yesterday as a thank you for a recent site I built (which we'll keep nameless at this point) and I've only gotten to play with it a little bit last night. My main guitar and pedal board are still up at the church from playing this last weekend, so I had to use one of my older guitars to play with it. So far I've very impressed with the quality of it. I also like that it has a switch that changes the swell for two unique sounds. Personally I like one over the other so I'll probably not be changing that. I have band practice tonight at church and hope to give this a good run and see how it sounds on stage.
I must say that this was an awesome gift from a client. They actually asked my project manager (who knows me pretty well) what I was interested in and he gave them this suggestion. I can't express how grateful and how excited I am to add this to my collection!

    <h2 class="post-title-list"><a href="/development/2011/10/18/site-vs-app.html">Site vs App</a></h2>
    <div class="post-content">When working on proposals for new work, I often get a raised eyebrow when someone hears that a simple app can cost a lot more than a large website. They think because the app might only consist of a single page and the site hundreds that the site is somehow much harder to put together.
When pondering this, I came up with an analogy... condos vs cottages. A condo can house many families while a cottage is generally for a single small family. If this is true, then why is it sometimes it can cost more to have a cottage built vs having a string of condo's built. The answer is simple... customization my friend, customization.
An online/web app may be smaller in size than a large website but believe me it usually takes a lot longer to build one out, and I can almost all but guarantee that the final product will have much more custom work in it than your standard website.
Note, that this is not ALWAYS the case, but in my line of work more times than not this rings true.
