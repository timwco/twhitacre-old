    <span class="date">January 27, 2013</span>
    <div class="post-content">
      Both my company an I have been using Media Temple for years now. We started on their Grid Server (shared hosting) but quickly realized we needed a much better server. That's when we moved to their Dedicated Virtual (dv) server. We've been running that for the past 3 years and have had no problems at all. In fact it's been the best hosting we've ever had.
Even though business is going well, we started looking at ways to save a little $$ here and there. We decided to re-evaluate our hosting platform and see how we could save money. After much consideration we decided to stick with MT since they've always been so good to us, but decided to switch to their (ve) server. The specs are almost the same and it's almost half the price.
The difference? Basically with the (dv) you are not only paying for hosting but also for a Plesk license. It gives you a nice GUI for interacting with the server. Since we already work a ton with command line on our other severs we decided we didn't need this luxury.
Ok, enough with the back story. Here's the HOW you've been waiting for. Keep in mind that this info is based around migrating from a (dv) to a (ve) server BUT it will help anyone looking to get started with MT's (ve) server.
Also, the info below is only for migrating a site to the (ve) and not how to "set it up". If you are looking for that, I recommend this article.
&nbsp;
1. First things first, SSH into your server. (you can use any user that you've set up or you can even use 'root')
2. Create the new site in your virtual host (replace with your domain and IP address)
[bash] sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/DOMAIN.COM [/bash]
Then add the following to the file
[plain]
&lt;VirtualHost YOUR-IP:80&gt;
ServerAdmin webmaster@DOMAIN.COM
ServerName DOMAIN.COM
ServerAlias www.DOMAIN.COM
DocumentRoot /var/www/DOMAIN.COM/html/
ErrorLog /var/www/DOMAIN.COM/logs/error.log
CustomLog /var/www/DOMAIN.COM/logs/access.log combined
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
[/plain]
You'll also need to know how to use Vi, and can find out more HERE, but for know just know that :q will QUIT the file and :wq will WRITE it before you QUIT.
3. Now we need to create the directories we specified above "html" and "logs"
[bash]
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/DOMAIN.COM/html
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/DOMAIN.COM/logs
[/bash]
4. Then just add the site to Apache and reload it.
[bash]
sudo a2ensite DOMAIN.COM
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload
[/bash]
5. Make the folder writeable use either 755 or 777 (just be cautious of security)
[bash] sudo chmod 777 /var/www/DOMAIN.COM/html [/bash]
6. Copy over your files from your (dv) to your (ve) and verify it's all there - http://ip-address/domain.com/html/
7. Now comes the database part. If your site is database-less then you can move on to the last step otherwise see below.
First log in to MySQL via command line (I prefer to log in with root)
[bash] mysql -u root -p [/bash]
Second, create the database and set up a user and password
[bash] create database DATABASE-NAME; grant all on DATABASE-NAME.* to 'USERNAME' identified by 'PASSWORD'; [/bash]
Third, exit MySQL and import your .SQL file into the database. I personally found the easiest way to do this is to first upload your .SQL file to the root of your /html/ folder then run the following.
[bash] mysql -u root -p DATABASE-NAME &lt; /var/www/DOMAIN.COM/html/FILENAME.SQL [/bash]
8. Lastly, log into your OLD (dv) and remove the DNS Zone and then log into your new (ve) and add the new DNS Zone.... or you could just use MT's built in Point to Another Server Tool.
That should be it... let me know if you have any issues or run into any problems.

      Quite often, I get asked what kind of set up I have and what programs I use on a daily basis. About a year ago, I wrote a post, but below is an updated list... this time I'll stick to development related programs.
Also, below you'll find some info my current hardware setup as well.
Software

Coda 2 - came out in 2012 and I've been very pleased with it.
Sublime Text 2 - even though Coda has been updated... I still turn to ST2 when I need nothing but pure speed.
MAMP Pro - running sites locally.
Terminal - I used to use iTerm... but switched back since I feel this does a good enough job on it's own. Also, I use Coda 2's terminal as well.
ColorSnapper - grabs colors
ForkLift - switched from Filezilla to ForkLift. Haven't looked back....
Chrome - even though it's a browser... it's one of the best tools a developer can have in his toolbox
Fireworks CS3
Photoshop CS6

&nbsp;
Hardware

2009 iMac - 16gb Ram, 500gb Hard Drive - 2 monitors connected to it.
2012 Macbook Pro 15" Retina - 8gb Ram, 256gb Hard Drive
iPhone 5 - 16gb
Google Nexus 7 16gb (my only non apple device - everyone should have at least one!)

      "Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover."
- Mark Twain
The above quote is one that my wife tends to use a lot, and for good reason. Honestly, I had never heard it until she brought it to my attention. I've spent the last few days reading it over and over and realizing that there is so much more to life than sitting at my desk programming. Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoy programming and my job... actually I can go as far to say that I love it.
Just a little over 3 years ago, I left an "office" job for a "at home" job. I can't tell you how excited I was, just knowing I would be able to spend more time with my wife... finally be able to get a dog and put more focus on things I had been distracted from. The only problem was... I was wrong. Well I do spend more time with my wife and we did get a dog... but all I've done for the past 3 years is program. I've launched a few side projects but my grand and glorious plans of "doing" more has been a complete flop.
I'm not a big fan of New Year's Resolutions... because they tend to remind me what failure feels like. This year, instead of making a list of resolutions... I'm making one. It's a pretty big one, but also one that is very very hard to fail at.
My 2013 New Year's Resolutions is to simply.... Do More.

Loose more weight...
Be more active...

Learn to be more efficient...
Love people more...
Read more...
Spend more time doing the things I've always wanted to...

That's it... I just want this year and every year to come to be filled with more than any other year prior.
I want to die without a bucket list.
