      It's that time of year again... Thanksgiving is over, Black Friday and Cyber Monday have passed. It's now time to look forward to Christmas. Christmas shopping is underway, I finally let my wife to play Christmas music and decorate the house. The one thing that glares at me though, is that just a week beyond Christmas is New Years... and the start of 2012. I'm not big on resolutions or anything of that nature, but I am big on starting fresh and I've got a TON of projects sitting around that I'd really like to get done and completed before the end of this year. I know it won't make a single bit of difference if they are done next week or the last week of January, but to me... having them done before my calendar changes to 2012 makes me feel much better about starting off the new year.
It's funny how I got to this point, because a few of these projects are ones that have been hanging around since much earlier this year. They, for some reason, have just continued to get pushed from month to month. Maybe this year for 2012 I should make a resolution to get everything done that year and not wait till December... it'll never work, but it's a nice thought right?
Wish me luck!

    <div class="post-content">
      Well, I've safely made it to Kansas and am going to be spending the next week with most of my immediate family. There are 11 of us in the house plus 4 dogs. It's going to be a great week!
I was sitting around this afternoon just thinking of how lucky I am. Not be cause of what I have, but because I am part of a big family that truly loves each other. Every year we try to get together for one holiday (Thanksgiving or Christmas) and have a gift exchange. It's always hard to think of what to ask for because the best part of it is the experience. Spending time with this many people (and animals) under one roof may seem crazy to a lot of people, but it's exactly where I want to be.
Everyone comes from a different family but I encourage you to take a moment and express what you are thankful for this year and if you are blessed enough to come from a family like mine, make sure you thank the members that have made it what it is.
Happy Thanksgiving!

    <div class="post-content">
      I'm in active development in a new WordPress theme and came across the age old question. Should I built in support for tags or not? Should I just leave the user with the ability to only use categories? I'm tempted to give them the option, but would I be doing them an injustice since most people rarely use tags and the ones that do, don't use them right?
I'm a huge fan of TentBlogger and decided to check out his website for an opinion. In his post "The Reasons I Use Categories Only for My Blogs and Why I Think Tags Are Absolutely Worthless", it helped me come to the conclusion that I'm going to omit tags from this upcoming theme I'm working on. I'm not even going to build it in. I'm not saying that I'll never build another WordPress theme that has "tag" abilities, but for the time being, and for SEO's sake... I think we can go with out tags for a little while.
