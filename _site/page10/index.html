    <span class="date">February 22, 2012</span>
    <div class="post-content">
      So, it's that time again. It comes once a year or so. The time to reformat your hard drive and get your computer as clean as a whistle.
I don't know about you,  but over time I download and install many different apps and then uninstall just about as many. That leaves my computer hating me. I can sense it getting more and more frustrated every time I drag a new application into the folder. Well not anymore. Today it's smiling right back at me. With a squeaky clean hard drive and a fresh updated OS (Lion) my computer is ruining on all cylinders.
I also get a lot of people asking me quite often what I use as far as programs go. Well, when I decided to do my reboot, I made a list of all the programs I needed for daily work before I wiped them so I'd have a reference to look back on. I've decided to share it below... broken up into category.
I hope someone else finds this useful.
 System Programs

Clean My Mac - very important. It keeps my mac running very smoothly.
Dropbox - for sharing files between co-workers
iBank - keeps my finances in order
VLC - the only way to watch movies
Carbonite - gotta keep things backed up

Programming Tools

Sublime Text 2 - wicked fast development
Coda - still pretty good... but slowly moving away from it for the one above
MAMP Pro - gotta have mamp
Sequal Pro - my favorite way to interact with my database locally and some online ones
iTerm - better version of Terminal
ColorSnapper - grabs colors
Filezilla - fastest FTP program I've ever used.

Office Stuff

Evernote - keeps things in sync
Pages - great word processor... much better than Word

Photo and Slicing Programs

Fireworks CS3 - I like this version the best
Photoshop CS5 - I finally upgraded and so far so good

Other than a few other random programs, that's all I run.

      Aiming to be a competitor of Google, so far they are doing a fairly good job. I mean let's face it, they'll never be as big as the company but they are fast and show very relevant results.
I really enjoy the fact that they don't lock you into the bubble, which means that you get results based on your search, not based on what you've liked, searched for prior or what THEY (Google, Bing, Yahoo) think you want. They also don't store your results or search history so everything presented is not biased in any way.
My FAVORITE part of DuckDuckGo is that they have all these neat short cuts to navigate around and an awesome set of goodies that geeks can use to get better search results.
All in all, they are a huge win and I hope to see them grow.
I'll admit, I still use Google cause sometimes I WANT biased results, but DuckDuckGo is becoming something I'm using more and more.

    <span class="date">January 5, 2012</span>
    <div class="post-content">
      So, now that I'm done ranting about Godaddy and all of the nonsense going on over there, I decided to focus my efforts on something more positive. Over the holiday break (I took a few days off), I decided to put the finishing touch on a website I'd been wanting to launch for some time.

A few months back, I reached out to some friends who share a similar interest in music but were not completely satisfied with the current sites out there. After figuring everything out and getting one of the best web designers alive to help me design a logo, I set to work on the actual meat of the site.
On Friday, December 30, I pushed the big publish button and The Noise Lounge went live.
Take a look... tell me what you think...
