              <h1>Hi, I'm Tim.</h1>
<p>I'm a web developer living in Clarks Summit, PA with my <a href="http://stephwhitacre.com"> wife</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/timwco/status/380106241814843392">dog</a>. I've been developing web sites and applications for the past 12 years. I have had the privilege to work with some large and small ecommerce shops such as <a href="http://solidcactus.com">Solid Cactus</a>, <a href="http://web.com">Web.com</a> and <a href="http://fastpivot.com">FastPivot</a>. I also co-founded two companies, <a href="http://argyllstudios.com">Argyll Studios</a> and <a href="http://hostednotes.com">Hosted Notes</a>. The latter was sold early on in 2013.</p>

I looked around and finally found a program called "Mac Keeper" and thought I'd give it a try. I should have done my research first as it ended up deleting quite a few of things I needed, such as a ton of program settings. Now I'm sure there's a setting that would avoid this but either way it happened.</p>
<p>Also, some how it managed to delete a working folder of a project which was 90% complete. Once I realized this I went into complete shock and began a search for a program that could recover the data. I finally found a program that would get my settings back but that folder was gone for good. I put my head down and realized I'd have to start all over from scratch and knew I had better quit sulking and just get to it.</p>
<p>Funny thing though, I was able to re-create the ENTIRE project in less than 30 minutes compared to the hours it took to get there prior. Why was this? I guess the human mind just works in amazing ways. I felt like Shawn Spencer on Psych... as I created new files with the same name, the code just came back to me... and flowed out of my fingertips to the screen.</p>
<p>My lucky day I guess...</p>
