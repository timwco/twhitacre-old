              <h1>Hi, I'm Tim.</h1>
<p>I'm a web developer living in Clarks Summit, PA with my <a href="http://stephwhitacre.com"> wife</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/timwco/status/380106241814843392">dog</a>. I've been developing web sites and applications for the past 12 years. I have had the privilege to work with some large and small ecommerce shops such as <a href="http://solidcactus.com">Solid Cactus</a>, <a href="http://web.com">Web.com</a> and <a href="http://fastpivot.com">FastPivot</a>. I also co-founded two companies, <a href="http://argyllstudios.com">Argyll Studios</a> and <a href="http://hostednotes.com">Hosted Notes</a>. The latter was sold early on in 2013.</p>

    <h1 class="page-title" itemprop="name headline" >Reboot</h1>
    <div itemprop="articleBody"><p>So, it's that time again. It comes once a year or so. The time to reformat your hard drive and get your computer as clean as a whistle.</p>
<p>I don't know about you,  but over time I download and install many different apps and then uninstall just about as many. That leaves my computer hating me. I can sense it getting more and more frustrated every time I drag a new application into the folder. Well not anymore. Today it's smiling right back at me. With a squeaky clean hard drive and a fresh updated OS (Lion) my computer is ruining on all cylinders.</p>
<p>I also get a lot of people asking me quite often what I use as far as programs go. Well, when I decided to do my reboot, I made a list of all the programs I needed for daily work before I wiped them so I'd have a reference to look back on. I've decided to share it below... broken up into category.</p>
<p>I hope someone else finds this useful.</p>
<p><strong> System Programs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Clean My Mac - very important. It keeps my mac running very smoothly.</li>
<li>Dropbox - for sharing files between co-workers</li>
<li>iBank - keeps my finances in order</li>
<li>VLC - the only way to watch movies</li>
<li>Carbonite - gotta keep things backed up</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Programming Tools</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sublime Text 2 - wicked fast development</li>
<li>Coda - still pretty good... but slowly moving away from it for the one above</li>
<li>MAMP Pro - gotta have mamp</li>
<li>Sequal Pro - my favorite way to interact with my database locally and some online ones</li>
<li>iTerm - better version of Terminal</li>
<li>ColorSnapper - grabs colors</li>
<li>Filezilla - fastest FTP program I've ever used.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Office Stuff</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Evernote - keeps things in sync</li>
<li>Pages - great word processor... much better than Word</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Photo and Slicing Programs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fireworks CS3 - I like this version the best</li>
<li>Photoshop CS5 - I finally upgraded and so far so good</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than a few other random programs, that's all I run.</p>
