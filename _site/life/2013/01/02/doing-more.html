    <p>Hi. I'm Tim, a hacker and teacher living in Atlanta.</p>
    <p>When not hacking on a project you can find me playing music or running wild.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title">Doing More</h2>
  <div class="post-content"><blockquote>"Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover."</p>
<p>- Mark Twain</p></blockquote>
<p>The above quote is one that my wife tends to use a lot, and for good reason. Honestly, I had never heard it until she brought it to my attention. I've spent the last few days reading it over and over and realizing that there is so much more to life than sitting at my desk programming. Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoy programming and my job... actually I can go as far to say that I love it.</p>
<p>Just a little over 3 years ago, I left an "office" job for a "at home" job. I can't tell you how excited I was, just knowing I would be able to spend more time with my wife... finally be able to get a dog and put more focus on things I had been distracted from. The only problem was... I was wrong. Well I do spend more time with my wife and we did get a dog... but all I've done for the past 3 years is program. I've launched a few side projects but my grand and glorious plans of "doing" more has been a complete flop.</p>
<p>I'm not a big fan of New Year's Resolutions... because they tend to remind me what failure feels like. This year, instead of making a list of resolutions... I'm making one. It's a pretty big one, but also one that is very very hard to fail at.</p>
<p>My 2013 New Year's Resolutions is to simply.... Do More.</p>
<ul>
<li>Loose <em>more</em> weight...</li>
<li>Be <em>more</em> active...<em><br />
</em></li>
<li>Learn to be <em>more</em> efficient...</li>
<li>Love people <em>more</em>...</li>
<li>Read <em>more</em>...</li>
<li>Spend <em>more</em> time doing the things I've always wanted to...</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it... I just want this year and every year to come to be filled with more than any other year prior.</p>
<p>I want to die without a bucket list.</p>
