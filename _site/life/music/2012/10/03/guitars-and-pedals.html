              <h1>Hi, I'm Tim.</h1>
<p>I'm a web developer living in Clarks Summit, PA with my <a href="http://stephwhitacre.com"> wife</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/timwco/status/380106241814843392">dog</a>. I've been developing web sites and applications for the past 12 years. I have had the privilege to work with some large and small ecommerce shops such as <a href="http://solidcactus.com">Solid Cactus</a>, <a href="http://web.com">Web.com</a> and <a href="http://fastpivot.com">FastPivot</a>. I also co-founded two companies, <a href="http://argyllstudios.com">Argyll Studios</a> and <a href="http://hostednotes.com">Hosted Notes</a>. The latter was sold early on in 2013.</p>

    <div itemprop="articleBody"><p><img class="size-medium wp-image-370 alignright" alt="IMG_0005" src="http://timw.co/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_0005-224x300.jpg" width="224" height="300" />It's no secret that I thoroughly enjoy <a href="http://thenoiselounge.com">music</a>, but many may not know that I also play myself. I have the privilege of co-leading the student band at <a href="http://parkerhill.org">our church</a> on a weekly basis and getting to lead a group of up to 75 middle school students in worship every Sunday.</p>
<p>Another thing about me is I'm a gear hound... I can never seem to have enough. While I consider myself very good with our finances, I do have a week spot.</p>
<p>Over the last few weeks, I've been re-building my pedal board and somehow in the middle of it all, I also picked up a new guitar.</p>
<p>We'll start with the guitar. It's a <a href="http://www.ibanez.com/HollowBodyGuitars/model-AS73">Ibanez Artcore AS73</a>, a semi-hollow body guitar that sounds just as pretty as it looks. Since I play a variety of different types of music, I needed something that was a little less aggressive than my current guitar (<a href="http://www.schecterguitars.com/International/Vault/15/C-1-ELITE-2001-2007.aspx">Schecter C1-Elite</a>) and I just happened to find this guitar for a steal.</p>
<p>After my bank account recovered from that purchase, I went back to finalizing my pedal board... for now.</p>
<p>I'll break it down for you based off of the signal chain (from my guitar to my amp).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-374" alt="IMG_0015" src="http://timw.co/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IMG_0015-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Korg Pitch Black Tuner - best tuner I've ever used... especially on a dark stage</li>
<li>SHO Clone - this is similar to an EP Booster... it gives my signal a boost while preserving the sound</li>
<li>CMATMODS Brownie - this is one of the best overdrive pedals I've ever played. I keep the drive down low and use it for less aggressive songs.</li>
<li>Fulltone OCD - this is my second overdrive pedal and I use it for more aggressive songs. It can go from a sweet overdrive to a crushing distortion all while sounding unbelievable. I will never have a pedal board without this one.</li>
<li>Ernie Ball Passive Volume Pedal - controls volume</li>
<li>Boss DD5 (with external tap tempo I built myself) - I keep this on the dotted eighth note setting and tap in the tempo of the song we are playing.</li>
<li>Boss RV5 - I'm not HUGE on reverb, but I do like this pedal a lot. I generally keep it on the modulation setting but changed it up every now and then.</li>
<li>Lastly, I run from my RV5 to a Line 6 POD 2.0 and essentially use that as my amp. I use the Vox AC 15 setting and I've very happy with the overall sound.</li>
