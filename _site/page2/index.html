    <h2 class="post-title-list"><a href="/2014/02/10/thoughts-on-email.html">Thoughts on Email</a></h2>
    <div class="post-content">First, let me clarify my relationship with email. When it comes the jobs I’ve had, I went from working in an office, to working from home, doing freelance and now back in an office. It might not sound like much of a switch, but each one required different levels of communication to stay up to speed. For instance, my first office job was in a building that had about 150 employees. Not huge, but a lot of people were not close by. When it came to the developers and designers I was currently sharing a project with, we used instant message, but when it came to people in a different division (or people I’d rather not talk to that often) email came in mighty handy.When I left my first office job, and started working from home I realized that I would need to step up my email game. Again, anyone I was working with very closely, we kept in contact through IM or a chatroom like Campfire. The difference this time was not the size of the company (only about 10 people) but rather the fact that sometimes something was just too long to say in a quick message. At my office job, I would walk over to that person, pull up a chair and have a conversation. From home, this wasn’t possible. My options were either Skype or email. Since Skype takes a minimum of 10 minutes and 5 crashes before successfully starting, I usually chose email.Fast forward to today. I’m back working full time in an office. This time however, the team is small at only 7 people, with 5 of them being in earshot of me all day long. More important than this though, we’ve started using a program called Slack (which I highly recommend) and it has all but rid my need of email for the work I’m currently doing. We also use other tools like Trello and Google Docs. All of this combined there isn’t much reason for me to open email at work.Based on my current situation, I am going to try something. This has been suggested many times before by other people in a variety of ways, but starting today, I’m only going to check my email 3 times a day. I’m going to attempt to check it morning, noon and afternoon/evening. This way, I can still get back to people in a timely fashion but the constant barrage or email flooding in throughout the day won’t distract me from what I’m currently trying to accomplish. The only time I will break this is if someone needs something and I have to send it via email or if someone specifically tells me to check my email for an attachment. Otherwise, they will have to wait to get a response from me. You see, my biggest issue is not email from friends, family or co-workers, but rather the fringe email that makes its way in. I’ve signed up for quite a few newsletters over the years. Many I’m still happy to be a part of and a few that I wish would just let me unsubscribe. The problem isn’t that I don’t want to read them, but rather that I do. I want to see the updates on the new app coming out, and I want to read what some of my friends wrote about, but I don’t NEED to read about it right now. I’ve begun treating email like a glorified checklist of items I need to work through, with the goal of having all accomplished (archived or deleted). This means if one comes in while I’m working on something, the tendency is to jump over and take care of it. By removing the constant thread of email coming in throughout the day and limiting it to a few times a day, I can easily stay focused and possibly even reduce some stress.You can always hit me up on Twitter, as I’ll usually respond much quicker there.

    <h2 class="post-title-list"><a href="/2013/12/31/year-in-review-2013.html">Year In Review : 2013</a></h2>
    <div class="post-content">This time of year, there are thousands of articles (likely more) being written with a similar title or one relating to next years resolutions. I know they are cliched and most people don't really care all that much, but I did write an article at the beginning of this year and wanted to put out a recap of it.The article I'm referring to is titled "Doing More" and it was this idea that over the course of 2013 and all years following I would simply put a focus on doing bigger and better things each year. I also outlined quite a few goals such as loosing weight, reading more and doing things that I've always wanted. Unfortunately, I didn't loose as much as I wanted this year, so that is one that I need to continue to work on. I did read more... a lot more actually.One thing I did in 2013 that I have always wanted to do was going to Yosemite. Let me first say if you haven't been there, start planning a trip right now, it is worth every penny. When I wrote that article, I had no idea that I would have the opportunity to go. Shortly into the month of January I realized that my wife and I had not been on a vacation (just the two of us) since our honeymoon 6+ years prior. I knew I needed to plan something but never thought it would have been to go across the country to one of the most beautiful places on earth. In short, it was life changing and I would go back every year (or week) if I could.Lastly, the biggest thing that happened to me this year was I officially jumped ship from the services industry to the product industry. I left my comfortable job of developing websites and apps for other people and joined an awesome team and am currently developing the coolest thing I have ever worked on. Not a day goes by that I am not grateful for this opportunity and excited to see where it goes. If you would like to hear more about this story, feel free to check out the podcast Chasing Product which I was a guest on earlier this year.There are many things I wish I did this year and more on my list for 2014 but I am happy to report that it is a very nice feeling to end a year with few regrets.I still have a bucket list... but I'm not dead yet.

    <h2 class="post-title-list"><a href="/2013/12/15/my-terminal-setup.html">My Terminal Setup</a></h2>
    <div class="post-content">As I mentioned earlier this year, I switched back to the OS X built in terminal for my everyday coding needs. I like to keep as few programs on my computer as possible and since terminal is baked in, I just stick with it. One thing I missed was some of the customization I got when using programs such as iTerm. To combat that, I began looking around for some ways to trick out my terminal, both in appearance but also (and more importantly) in functionality.  First step, download and install TotalTerminal. While this is technically another program, you only know it by the extra settings window under Terminal > Preferences. This program adds the ability to open the terminal window from the top/bottom of your screen with a simple key command. I'm currently using CMD + Left Arrow.When it comes down to the meat of my terminal window, I have chosen to use the Zsh shell as opposed to the built in Bash shell. Added to this, I also use Robby Russell's Oh-My-Zsh framework which is where most customization comes in. I won't go into much setup here as this has already been done many times before, but it's fairly easy. Just install Zsh, followed by Oh-My-Zsh and start configuring the .zshrc file.Here is what mine looks like:# Path to your oh-my-zsh configuration.ZSH=$HOME/.oh-my-zsh# ThemeZSH_THEME="cloud"# Aliasesalias zshconfig="subl ~/.zshrc"alias ohmyzsh="subl ~/.oh-my-zsh"# Waiting DotsCOMPLETION_WAITING_DOTS="true"# Pluginsplugins=(git)source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.shAs you can see, I keep things pretty simple. I use the cloud theme, have a few alias set up and am currently only using the GIT plugin. There are MANY other plugins you can use as well.There you have it, my simple terminal setup. Not too many frills, but between the key command to open terminal, and the GIT plugin to always know what branch I'm on and if there are uncommitted changes it makes for quite a nice daily work environment.

    <h2 class="post-title-list"><a href="/2013/10/29/code-tonic-on-github.html">Code & Tonic on GitHub</a></h2>
    <div class="post-content">About 2 months ago, I launched a new website - Code & Tonic. I enjoy blogging but rarely get make time to sit down and do it. So, I had the idea to create a simple website where I could share sites, articles and products that I find awesome but don't want to write an entire article about.Tonight, I decided to make the code available on GitHub  Even though I took an existing awesome WordPress theme and turned it into a Barley theme, I still felt it might help some people who are getting started with Barley.You can head over to the GitHub repo and download it if you'd like. As always, feed back is appreciated.
