    <div class="post-content">So, now that I'm done ranting about Godaddy and all of the nonsense going on over there, I decided to focus my efforts on something more positive. Over the holiday break (I took a few days off), I decided to put the finishing touch on a website I'd been wanting to launch for some time.

A few months back, I reached out to some friends who share a similar interest in music but were not completely satisfied with the current sites out there. After figuring everything out and getting one of the best web designers alive to help me design a logo, I set to work on the actual meat of the site.
On Friday, December 30, I pushed the big publish button and The Noise Lounge went live.
Take a look... tell me what you think...

    <h2 class="post-title-list"><a href="/development/life/2011/12/23/good-bye-go-daddy.html">Goodbye Go Daddy!</a></h2>
    <div class="post-content">Ohhhh man, I can't even begin to explain how happy I am right now. Let me give you a little back story...
&nbsp;
Quite a few years ago when I first started getting into the "web business" I needed a registrar. Back then there wasn't too many to choose from and everywhere I looked Go Daddy stood out as not only being the cheapest but being the biggest and most reliable. Back then, that's all I cared about. Since then I've learned that having a good registrar (as well as a webhost) is just as important as having a good mechanic, lawyer or even doctor. They essentially have control over your domain (even though you own it).
A few years ago, I started seeing all the horrible things about Go Daddy. I'm not a big fan of their advertising, not only because it is just something I don't think everyone needs to see (namely children), but they are using sex to sell domain names. It doesn't' even make sense. Aside from that though, I hate that I pay them a good sum of money each year and they still email and call and try to up-sell me around every corner. I know what I'm doing, I bought what I wanted. It's like a Walmart employee following me home to try and sell me catnip when I don't even have a cat. It's just poor business. Then there was the incident involving the owner of the company shooting an elephant for sport. I'm not an animal activist, but I do have respect for the creatures we share the earth with and think the whole thing was just one big publicity stunt. The final thing that pushed me over the edge was Go Daddy's recent show of support in favor of the SOPA bill. I'm not for piracy, but I'm extremely against the SOPA bill and what it stands for.

I've been telling my clients for years to stay away from them and finally last night at 1am, I decided to take my own advice.
I started by transferring my personal domains and then followed that by all my business domains as well. It was time, and I feel very good about it.

    <div class="post-content">It's that time of year again... Thanksgiving is over, Black Friday and Cyber Monday have passed. It's now time to look forward to Christmas. Christmas shopping is underway, I finally let my wife to play Christmas music and decorate the house. The one thing that glares at me though, is that just a week beyond Christmas is New Years... and the start of 2012. I'm not big on resolutions or anything of that nature, but I am big on starting fresh and I've got a TON of projects sitting around that I'd really like to get done and completed before the end of this year. I know it won't make a single bit of difference if they are done next week or the last week of January, but to me... having them done before my calendar changes to 2012 makes me feel much better about starting off the new year.
It's funny how I got to this point, because a few of these projects are ones that have been hanging around since much earlier this year. They, for some reason, have just continued to get pushed from month to month. Maybe this year for 2012 I should make a resolution to get everything done that year and not wait till December... it'll never work, but it's a nice thought right?
Wish me luck!

    <h2 class="post-title-list"><a href="/life/2011/11/23/thankful.html">Thankful</a></h2>
    <div class="post-content">Well, I've safely made it to Kansas and am going to be spending the next week with most of my immediate family. There are 11 of us in the house plus 4 dogs. It's going to be a great week!
I was sitting around this afternoon just thinking of how lucky I am. Not be cause of what I have, but because I am part of a big family that truly loves each other. Every year we try to get together for one holiday (Thanksgiving or Christmas) and have a gift exchange. It's always hard to think of what to ask for because the best part of it is the experience. Spending time with this many people (and animals) under one roof may seem crazy to a lot of people, but it's exactly where I want to be.
Everyone comes from a different family but I encourage you to take a moment and express what you are thankful for this year and if you are blessed enough to come from a family like mine, make sure you thank the members that have made it what it is.
Happy Thanksgiving!

    <h2 class="post-title-list"><a href="/development/2011/11/08/tags-or-categories.html">Wordpress Post Tags or Categories</a></h2>
    <div class="post-content">I'm in active development in a new WordPress theme and came across the age old question. Should I built in support for tags or not? Should I just leave the user with the ability to only use categories? I'm tempted to give them the option, but would I be doing them an injustice since most people rarely use tags and the ones that do, don't use them right?
I'm a huge fan of TentBlogger and decided to check out his website for an opinion. In his post "The Reasons I Use Categories Only for My Blogs and Why I Think Tags Are Absolutely Worthless", it helped me come to the conclusion that I'm going to omit tags from this upcoming theme I'm working on. I'm not even going to build it in. I'm not saying that I'll never build another WordPress theme that has "tag" abilities, but for the time being, and for SEO's sake... I think we can go with out tags for a little while.
