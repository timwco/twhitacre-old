    <span class="date">January 4, 2013</span>
    <div class="post-content">
      Quite often, I get asked what kind of set up I have and what programs I use on a daily basis. About a year ago, I wrote a post, but below is an updated list... this time I'll stick to development related programs.
Also, below you'll find some info my current hardware setup as well.
Software

Coda 2 - came out in 2012 and I've been very pleased with it.
Sublime Text 2 - even though Coda has been updated... I still turn to ST2 when I need nothing but pure speed.
MAMP Pro - running sites locally.
Terminal - I used to use iTerm... but switched back since I feel this does a good enough job on it's own. Also, I use Coda 2's terminal as well.
ColorSnapper - grabs colors
ForkLift - switched from Filezilla to ForkLift. Haven't looked back....
Chrome - even though it's a browser... it's one of the best tools a developer can have in his toolbox
Fireworks CS3
Photoshop CS6

&nbsp;
Hardware

2009 iMac - 16gb Ram, 500gb Hard Drive - 2 monitors connected to it.
2012 Macbook Pro 15" Retina - 8gb Ram, 256gb Hard Drive
iPhone 5 - 16gb
Google Nexus 7 16gb (my only non apple device - everyone should have at least one!)

      "Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover."
- Mark Twain
The above quote is one that my wife tends to use a lot, and for good reason. Honestly, I had never heard it until she brought it to my attention. I've spent the last few days reading it over and over and realizing that there is so much more to life than sitting at my desk programming. Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoy programming and my job... actually I can go as far to say that I love it.
Just a little over 3 years ago, I left an "office" job for a "at home" job. I can't tell you how excited I was, just knowing I would be able to spend more time with my wife... finally be able to get a dog and put more focus on things I had been distracted from. The only problem was... I was wrong. Well I do spend more time with my wife and we did get a dog... but all I've done for the past 3 years is program. I've launched a few side projects but my grand and glorious plans of "doing" more has been a complete flop.
I'm not a big fan of New Year's Resolutions... because they tend to remind me what failure feels like. This year, instead of making a list of resolutions... I'm making one. It's a pretty big one, but also one that is very very hard to fail at.
My 2013 New Year's Resolutions is to simply.... Do More.

Loose more weight...
Be more active...

Learn to be more efficient...
Love people more...
Read more...
Spend more time doing the things I've always wanted to...

That's it... I just want this year and every year to come to be filled with more than any other year prior.
I want to die without a bucket list.

    <span class="date">November 19, 2012</span>
    <div class="post-content">
      This past weekend, I had an opportunity to head to Washington DC (first time) with some friends to be part of Move:DC put on by Invisible Children. This event was part of their year long movement to bring Joseph Kony to justice... also known as Kony 2012.
My wife and I have been supporting IC for the past 4 years and have been very proud to do so. For those of you who don't know, they exist to help bring restitution to those affected by the LRA. So far, they are doing a really good job. I won't go into specifics, since you can read all the updates on their website, but I'll just say that things are happening and in this dark world we live in, it's great to be a part of something that is making a difference. Even if only one life was saved (and there have been many), it would all be worth it.
