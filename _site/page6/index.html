      When ever you start a new project it's very important to have the right tools. Today, I decided to tackle one of the many projects that has been looming over my head. Before I got started, I took a step back to figure out which tools I would need. When doing a project around the house and realizing I need a tool that I currently don't have, it usually means a trip to Lowes and probably a lot of money. Luckily with the type of development I do, many (if not all) of the tools I need are free.Here are a few I got to install today (though to be fair, I've used them all before... just not on this machine)Composer, Laravel & Homebrew

      It's no&nbsp;&nbsp;surprise&nbsp;that I'm a huge fan of Sublime Text and in fact most of the team&nbsp;I work with&nbsp;uses it as well. When creating Barley templates, we wanted a way to make it a little easier.&nbsp;I've never created a Sublime Text plugin before, but found it to be fairly easy, especially the nature of this one.Feel free to check it out and let me know your thoughts. If you are a developer looking to create Barley templates, please let us know, and hopefully this will make your life a little easier.Download Here -&nbsp;https://github.com/twhitacre/Barley-Sublime-Helper

    <span class="date">July 14, 2013</span>
    <div class="post-content">
      I started working for Plain back in May, but had been working on Barley since earlier this year. As with most developers, my website always gets neglected because after working all day long on client's websites, the last thing I want to do at night is work on mine.&nbsp;Well, I finally had some time this weekend to set up my site on Barley... it took just a few hours. Going forward it will be much easier for me to continue to write and share my thoughts and possibly some code snippets here and there.&nbsp;Also, this is my first time actually using Barley outside of my testing. I'm excited about this because it will let me feel what our users feel and allow me to focus my code on making the experience that much better.&nbsp;
