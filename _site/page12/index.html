So it's been a bit since I've added anything to my pedal board (which I will review at some point), but I was recently given a gift from a client. It's an Ernie Ball Volume Pedal JR. I've never used a VP before but have always been interested in getting one. The pedal came in the mail yesterday as a thank you for a recent site I built (which we'll keep nameless at this point) and I've only gotten to play with it a little bit last night. My main guitar and pedal board are still up at the church from playing this last weekend, so I had to use one of my older guitars to play with it. So far I've very impressed with the quality of it. I also like that it has a switch that changes the swell for two unique sounds. Personally I like one over the other so I'll probably not be changing that. I have band practice tonight at church and hope to give this a good run and see how it sounds on stage.
I must say that this was an awesome gift from a client. They actually asked my project manager (who knows me pretty well) what I was interested in and he gave them this suggestion. I can't express how grateful and how excited I am to add this to my collection!

    <span class="date">October 18, 2011</span>
    <div class="post-content">
      When working on proposals for new work, I often get a raised eyebrow when someone hears that a simple app can cost a lot more than a large website. They think because the app might only consist of a single page and the site hundreds that the site is somehow much harder to put together.
When pondering this, I came up with an analogy... condos vs cottages. A condo can house many families while a cottage is generally for a single small family. If this is true, then why is it sometimes it can cost more to have a cottage built vs having a string of condo's built. The answer is simple... customization my friend, customization.
An online/web app may be smaller in size than a large website but believe me it usually takes a lot longer to build one out, and I can almost all but guarantee that the final product will have much more custom work in it than your standard website.
Note, that this is not ALWAYS the case, but in my line of work more times than not this rings true.

      Well, I updated to iOS 5.0 just a couple days ago and so far so good. It's hard to believe that an OS update of any kind can show considerable improvement in speed when the device hasn't changed at all... as I'm still running the iPhone 4.
I'm very impressed with the updates to the notifications and the camera as a whole but to me the one thing that I love the most is the text-expansion. I'll admit it, I'm not very good at texting and having the ability to create my own shortcuts makes for a much easier time to respond to the few texts I get on a daily basis.
My favorite so far is "amw"... when I type that it will expand to "let me ask my wife". This gets me out of a lot of things I don't want to do.
