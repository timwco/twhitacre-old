    <span class="date">December 15, 2013</span>
    <div class="post-content">
      As I mentioned earlier this year, I switched back to the OS X built in terminal for my everyday coding needs. I like to keep as few programs on my computer as possible and since terminal is baked in, I just stick with it. One thing I missed was some of the customization I got when using programs such as iTerm. To combat that, I began looking around for some ways to trick out my terminal, both in appearance but also (and more importantly) in functionality.  First step, download and install TotalTerminal. While this is technically another program, you only know it by the extra settings window under Terminal > Preferences. This program adds the ability to open the terminal window from the top/bottom of your screen with a simple key command. I'm currently using CMD + Left Arrow.When it comes down to the meat of my terminal window, I have chosen to use the Zsh shell as opposed to the built in Bash shell. Added to this, I also use Robby Russell's Oh-My-Zsh framework which is where most customization comes in. I won't go into much setup here as this has already been done many times before, but it's fairly easy. Just install Zsh, followed by Oh-My-Zsh and start configuring the .zshrc file.Here is what mine looks like:# Path to your oh-my-zsh configuration.ZSH=$HOME/.oh-my-zsh# ThemeZSH_THEME="cloud"# Aliasesalias zshconfig="subl ~/.zshrc"alias ohmyzsh="subl ~/.oh-my-zsh"# Waiting DotsCOMPLETION_WAITING_DOTS="true"# Pluginsplugins=(git)source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.shAs you can see, I keep things pretty simple. I use the cloud theme, have a few alias set up and am currently only using the GIT plugin. There are MANY other plugins you can use as well.There you have it, my simple terminal setup. Not too many frills, but between the key command to open terminal, and the GIT plugin to always know what branch I'm on and if there are uncommitted changes it makes for quite a nice daily work environment.

      About 2 months ago, I launched a new website - Code & Tonic. I enjoy blogging but rarely get make time to sit down and do it. So, I had the idea to create a simple website where I could share sites, articles and products that I find awesome but don't want to write an entire article about.Tonight, I decided to make the code available on GitHub  Even though I took an existing awesome WordPress theme and turned it into a Barley theme, I still felt it might help some people who are getting started with Barley.You can head over to the GitHub repo and download it if you'd like. As always, feed back is appreciated.

    <span class="date">August 24, 2013</span>
    <div class="post-content">
      I'm one of those guys who's always writing down ideas for new projects. Generally these are projects that will push a certain skill of mine to the next level. Sometimes, however they are simply something that I just want to do to for fun with no specific agenda.&nbsp;I was looking for an easy way to organize these "projects" and tried about every free version of a project management tool I could find. In the end, I came back to Trello. It has served me well in the past and to be honest, I'm not really sure why I didn't go with it in the first place. After about an hour of setting up a new board, I'm happy to say I've been able to not only organize my personal projects, but also prioritize them as well.
