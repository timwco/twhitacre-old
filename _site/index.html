I&#39;m going to challenge you to do something crazy...


That was the first line in an email I received less than 1 month after the startup I was at ran into some trouble. And crazy it is, but also very exciting.

    <div class="post-content">If you’ve followed me on twitter or instagram you know that I like to indulge once in a while. So far my drink of choice has been gin. Plymouth Gin to be exact. As great as gin is, I have been told I should be drinking whiskey, at least some of the time. This includes all forms, bourbon, scotch, irish, rye and the likes. I’ll be honest, so far my favorite is rye with scotch being a close second but I have a long list to try and will hopefully be adding to the list as time goes on.

    <h2 class="post-title-list"><a href="/2014/03/28/so-many-bookmarks.html">So Many Bookmarks</a></h2>
    <div class="post-content">I don’t have to tell you this, but there is a lot of stuff on the internet. Obviously most of it is junk, but there is a lot of great content. This begs the question, “how do I consume it all” or rather, “how do I consume as much as I can that is relevant to me so I can keep up to speed in my industry”. This is not an easy task and because content and the way content is presented continually changes, you almost have no choice but to use some sort of service to help you keep up with it all. Whether it is an aggregation service like thenews.im or the interesting app, whatever your poison it still doesn’t help with things your friends, co-workers and twitter users share. You need a way to trap that content so when you have a chance to take a break you haven’t forgotten it.In walks Unmark. Many may have guessed I would talk about this eventually as I had a hand in building it, but I was part of this build because I knew the way I was saving my bookmarks was broken. Every service I used, while many were good, they still missed something. I’ve found that they just fill up with links I never visit again.Take this situation for example: I’m sitting at my desk working and a co-worker says I should read this article. I don’t want to stop what I’m doing but is throwing it into one of these services the best idea. I’m not even sure what the article is about and not sure if I really am interested in it. This is the same for videos, code examples and any other link that is shared or I stumble upon throughout the day.This, IMO is why Unmark is so awesome. Our tagline for it is ‘The to do app for your bookmarks”. This means as a piece of content comes along during the day, I can simply throw it into my Unmark account. Later that night from my iPad or phone I can go through the list of marks I saved and see if they really are as good as I first thought. If they are, I can send them to be read later, or watch the video right inside of Unmark. If it is a recipe, I can look at the ingredient list and determine if I want to put in in a recipe storage app. While Unmark can be used in many different ways, this is how I use it and I have found it has changed the way I view content and the content I do end up consuming is more relevant and meaningful to me.

    <div class="post-content">Coworking is not a new concept at all. In fact not too long ago while working from home I was doing a ton of research for a coworking spot in this area. Unfortunately there wasn’t one… or at least one that I could be a part of.You see, anyone reading this who isn’t local might not realize that Scranton (and the surrounding area) is not a very technical place. I would even say that there are not really many tech companies in the area either.Well, some of the guys I work with are trying to change that. Enter CoalWork, a forthcoming coworking spot. We are still in the early stages but hope this will become a staple in city. We hope through this we’ll meet some awesome people, learn some new things and possibly even change the way this area views tech companies.Anyone who is interested, feel free to check out the website or follow CoalWork on Twitter.

    <div class="post-content">Well, it’s finally starting to warm up here in Northeast PA and I’m neck deep in finishing a soon to be released update to Unmark (formerly nilai.co).I get asked quite often by friends what are the most used apps on my iPhone. I thought this would be a great place to share them.The image below is a screenshot of my actual home screen on my iPhone 5. I’ve had it this way for probably the last 6 months and don’t plan to change anytime soon. Although with the thousands of app developers out there… that could change tomorrow.Here is a breakdown of some of my favorite apps.    Photo App - Camera PlusBrowser - Chrome for iOSWeather - Check the WeatherLists - AnyListReader - PocketPod Catcher - Pocket CastsMusic - RdioNews - InterestingMail - DefaultCalendar - DefaultI also do keep up on some social sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Foursquare and thus they landed a spot on my home screen. There are also many others I didn’t mention. If you have any questions or wonder what any are, feel free to hit me up on the tweetbox.
