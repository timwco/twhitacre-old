    <div class="post-content">
      About 2 months ago, I launched a new website - Code & Tonic. I enjoy blogging but rarely get make time to sit down and do it. So, I had the idea to create a simple website where I could share sites, articles and products that I find awesome but don't want to write an entire article about.Tonight, I decided to make the code available on GitHub  Even though I took an existing awesome WordPress theme and turned it into a Barley theme, I still felt it might help some people who are getting started with Barley.You can head over to the GitHub repo and download it if you'd like. As always, feed back is appreciated.

    <div class="post-content">
      I'm one of those guys who's always writing down ideas for new projects. Generally these are projects that will push a certain skill of mine to the next level. Sometimes, however they are simply something that I just want to do to for fun with no specific agenda.&nbsp;I was looking for an easy way to organize these "projects" and tried about every free version of a project management tool I could find. In the end, I came back to Trello. It has served me well in the past and to be honest, I'm not really sure why I didn't go with it in the first place. After about an hour of setting up a new board, I'm happy to say I've been able to not only organize my personal projects, but also prioritize them as well.

    <div class="post-content">
      When ever you start a new project it's very important to have the right tools. Today, I decided to tackle one of the many projects that has been looming over my head. Before I got started, I took a step back to figure out which tools I would need. When doing a project around the house and realizing I need a tool that I currently don't have, it usually means a trip to Lowes and probably a lot of money. Luckily with the type of development I do, many (if not all) of the tools I need are free.Here are a few I got to install today (though to be fair, I've used them all before... just not on this machine)Composer, Laravel & Homebrew
