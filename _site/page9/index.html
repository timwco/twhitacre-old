      Aiming to be a competitor of Google, so far they are doing a fairly good job. I mean let's face it, they'll never be as big as the company but they are fast and show very relevant results.
I really enjoy the fact that they don't lock you into the bubble, which means that you get results based on your search, not based on what you've liked, searched for prior or what THEY (Google, Bing, Yahoo) think you want. They also don't store your results or search history so everything presented is not biased in any way.
My FAVORITE part of DuckDuckGo is that they have all these neat short cuts to navigate around and an awesome set of goodies that geeks can use to get better search results.
All in all, they are a huge win and I hope to see them grow.
I'll admit, I still use Google cause sometimes I WANT biased results, but DuckDuckGo is becoming something I'm using more and more.

      So, now that I'm done ranting about Godaddy and all of the nonsense going on over there, I decided to focus my efforts on something more positive. Over the holiday break (I took a few days off), I decided to put the finishing touch on a website I'd been wanting to launch for some time.

A few months back, I reached out to some friends who share a similar interest in music but were not completely satisfied with the current sites out there. After figuring everything out and getting one of the best web designers alive to help me design a logo, I set to work on the actual meat of the site.
On Friday, December 30, I pushed the big publish button and The Noise Lounge went live.
Take a look... tell me what you think...

    <span class="date">December 23, 2011</span>
    <div class="post-content">
      Ohhhh man, I can't even begin to explain how happy I am right now. Let me give you a little back story...
&nbsp;
Quite a few years ago when I first started getting into the "web business" I needed a registrar. Back then there wasn't too many to choose from and everywhere I looked Go Daddy stood out as not only being the cheapest but being the biggest and most reliable. Back then, that's all I cared about. Since then I've learned that having a good registrar (as well as a webhost) is just as important as having a good mechanic, lawyer or even doctor. They essentially have control over your domain (even though you own it).
A few years ago, I started seeing all the horrible things about Go Daddy. I'm not a big fan of their advertising, not only because it is just something I don't think everyone needs to see (namely children), but they are using sex to sell domain names. It doesn't' even make sense. Aside from that though, I hate that I pay them a good sum of money each year and they still email and call and try to up-sell me around every corner. I know what I'm doing, I bought what I wanted. It's like a Walmart employee following me home to try and sell me catnip when I don't even have a cat. It's just poor business. Then there was the incident involving the owner of the company shooting an elephant for sport. I'm not an animal activist, but I do have respect for the creatures we share the earth with and think the whole thing was just one big publicity stunt. The final thing that pushed me over the edge was Go Daddy's recent show of support in favor of the SOPA bill. I'm not for piracy, but I'm extremely against the SOPA bill and what it stands for.

I've been telling my clients for years to stay away from them and finally last night at 1am, I decided to take my own advice.
I started by transferring my personal domains and then followed that by all my business domains as well. It was time, and I feel very good about it.
