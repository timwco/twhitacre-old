<h1>Hi, I'm Tim.</h1>
<p>I'm a web developer living in Atlanta, GA with my <a href="http://stephwhitacre.com"> wife</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/timwco/status/380106241814843392">dog</a>. I've been developing web sites and applications for the past 12 years. I have had the privilege to work with large and small shops and even a few startups. I also co-founded two companies, <a href="http://argyllstudios.com">Argyll Studios</a> and <a href="http://hostednotes.com">Hosted Notes</a>. The latter was successfully acquired in 2013. I had the privilege to build the front end of the <a href="http://getbarley.com">Barley Editor</a> and the app <a href="https://unmark.it">Unmark</a>.</p> 
<p>Currently I'm a Front End (JavaScript) instructor at <a href="http://theironyard.com">The Iron Yard</a>.</p>
